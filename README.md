# Machine Learning Models Implementation :rocket:

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models Implementation repository! In this project, we'll walk you through the process of implementing various machine learning models from scratch using the Employee Turnover dataset. Here's how you can get started:

## Prerequisites :clipboard:
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11.2 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## Models Implemented :gear:
We have implemented the following machine learning models from scratch using the Employee Turnover dataset:

- Logistic Regression 📊
- K Nearest Neighbours 🧮
- Support Vector Machines 📈
- Naïve Bayes 📉

## Setup :wrench:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
2. Install the required packages:

## Running the Models :computer:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the respective model notebook (e.g., `Logistic_Regression.ipynb`).
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand the implementation and run the model.
